# Hello_World
A repo to start my journey,



Hello World, welcome to my GitHub :)


This is Ronak Panahi, I have a Master's Degree from University of Illinois. A software developer in love with Coding and Playing with data and extracting different patterns in massive data-sets. 

I never start a project without checking the different requirement like a thousand times and always give a 100% in every and each of them delivering the best I can. Java and C are the languages I have worked with and totally love them, when I program with C I think to myself "yes lets get the hands dirty with machine" and Java I believe is the easier version of C, what ever others say, I dont care! I love programming with it (Eclipse, NetBeans you name it). After taking a couple of classes I am really finding scripting languages handy because they are really light weighted but you can do heavy stuff with them (like awk).

A bit about my hobbies: well, I have to say travelling and dancing are the sources of my energy and I love pets and kids (not really related but anyway) they cheer me up :)

Thanks for dropping by and reading :)
